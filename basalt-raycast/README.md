# Basalt Wallpaper

A Raycast extension for [Basalt](https://basalt.yevgenglukhov.com) — a daily wallpaper service with hand-picked fine art.

## What It Does

Shows you today's wallpaper from Basalt right in Raycast. The collection is classic paintings and artworks, all chosen by hand — no algorithmic slop.

You can:

- See today's wallpaper with details (title, artist, year)
- Set it as your desktop background
- Download the full-resolution image
- Read more about the artwork

## Commands

**View Today's Wallpapers**

This command shows you a list of three recent wallpapers from Basalt. You can browse through them, see a preview, and choose one to set as your desktop background or download.

**Set Random Wallpaper**

For a surprise. This command doesn't show any UI. It instantly fetches a random wallpaper from the Basalt collection and sets it as your desktop background.

## Why This Exists

If you use Basalt, this saves you a trip to the app or website. Just open Raycast, check today's art, set it if you like it, done.

## Requirements

None. You don't need the Basalt Mac app — the extension talks directly to the service.
